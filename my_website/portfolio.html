              <p>These game come from Scratch as part of my coding training. These games are kind of fun, but they are very simple. In the future, after I am done with my training, I hope to code more complex code that will take a lot more effort.
              I also dream of going beyond Scratch and go into more complex programs like Unity.</p>
              <p>These games aren't too hard to program. But they can be overwhelming to say the least.</p>
              <p>My Story is about Merlin about to die when he hears a voice. The voice says that he needs to do a deed in Camelot to get to Avalon and live for eternity. He goes on a quest for Camelot and discovers an awful truth.</p>
              <p>When creating this story, I had to know how to program story choices and know what to do when you have a failure. I had troubles running this story on Cloud9 but had no trouble in replit. I had to add "/" to every apostrophe I had. Also had to delete every < break > I had because it doesn't really work in python. I felt that the story was good but it was too simple and short. I could of had a story that was more fun and lasted longer. Also didn't look up much about Merlin and the Round Table which made parts of the story feel weird.</p>
              <p>I was reading other stories of python and they were intersting... I like them because they were creative and had a lot of thought to it. They were long yet fun.</p>
              <p>If I had to redo this project again I would change everything but mostly add more choices. Makes the story more interesting and fun.</p>
